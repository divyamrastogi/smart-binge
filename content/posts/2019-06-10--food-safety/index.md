Food is the most critical yet underrated aspect when we talk about health.
Eating out is not a crime, but eating unhygienic food leads to many health hazards. With the advent of so many food delivery services, many businesses have been selling unsafe and unsanitary food in the name of restaurants.

    - Wash hands with clean soap and water.
    - Keep your hair tied while cooking.
