### 5 Rules of Water intake

1.  Always be seated first and then drink your water. Whether its 2 sips or 2 glasses. While sitting our nervous system is relaxed. Also, our digestive system and kidneys function better.
2.  Always drink water in the form of sips as we drink tea or coffee. Do not swallow directly from the container.
3.  Always consume water at room temperature. Too cold water adversely affects the digestive system and hampers the absorption of the nutrients. Also, consumption of lukewarm water helps to increase metabolism. Using mud pots are the best for scorching summer time.
4.  Avoid drinking water with meals or just after the meals for better functioning of digestive enzymes. Maintain the gap of 30minutes.
5.  Always drink water in small quantity and frequently. Avoid drinking too much at a time.
