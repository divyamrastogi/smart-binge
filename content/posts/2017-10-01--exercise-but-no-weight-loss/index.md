### Question

I have started following the Diet with good physical activity and exercise regime. My sugar levels are better, my thyroid is better, my jeans are getting loose. BUT, I have not lost a single gram;infact I have Gained a couple of kilos. Why?

### Answer

First thing is to change that sad face to a broadly smiling one.
A good diet and weight training or resistance training increases fat free weight of you bones and muscles. That means giving some additional grams and kilos.
Technically, you can gain or loose upto 5 kgs of the body weight without gaining or loosing a gram of fat. Body weight is not the final aspect of measuring fitness
